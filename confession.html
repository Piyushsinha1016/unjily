    <h1>Angelie, I need to tell you something…</h1>
    <p>
      I don’t know exactly when it happened,
      but somewhere between our jokes, our late-night calls, and all your “babe”s…

      I fell for you.

      Maybe I haven’t said it officially — but this heart of mine? It’s already yours.

      You're the person I’ve been waiting to give my love to — not just for a moment, but for everything that comes next.

      I'm not rushing us, but when you're ready…  
      I’d love to call you mine — not just in secret, but for real. 💖

      — Piyush
