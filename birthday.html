        My dearest Angelie,

        Today youâ€™re not just turning 18 â€” youâ€™re stepping into your most beautiful chapter yet. ðŸŒ¸
        Even though distance separates us, my heart is right there beside you, celebrating every bit of you â€” your smile, your laughter, your strength, and your kindness.

        Youâ€™re not just growing older, youâ€™re growing more radiant â€” and I feel so lucky to know you. 

        Happy birthday, babe. This page was made with so much love, just for you.

        Yours always,  
        â€” Piyush
